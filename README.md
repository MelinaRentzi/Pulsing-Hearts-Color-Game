# Pulsing-Hearts-Color-Game
Guess the Color. RGB game using Javascript, HTML and CSS

This is a variation of the Color Game introduced in Colt Steele's Bootcamp on Udemy.

For this project, I turned the squares from this basic game https://codepen.io/MelinaRentzi/pen/oMbzzM to hearts,
and also added a heartbeat.
